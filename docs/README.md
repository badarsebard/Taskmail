# Taskmail
Taskmail is an app that combines an email client with a Kanban-style task board. Emails and tasks are presented in the same way and can be managed together or even combined.

## Active Development
This app is under active development. Please check back for an upcoming release date. In the meantime, I encourage anyone interested in this project to review the [roadmap](roadmap.md) and to open issues for feature requests. This will help me prioritize development after the initial launch.
